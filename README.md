## introduction

Hello, my name is JakeHong. I have experience in programming languages such as NFT web3, AWS Amplify, web back-end (Node.js, PHP), Python, and Golang. I graduated from the Department of Computer and Communication Engineering at National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology and I am currently pursuing a master's degree.

I enjoy the process of learning a new programming language and gradually becoming familiar with its usage, as it provides me with a great sense of accomplishment when I can develop an application. Through this process, I gain a deeper understanding of important skills such as debugging, application design concepts, project planning, and more. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to new challenges and opportunities in the field of software development.
